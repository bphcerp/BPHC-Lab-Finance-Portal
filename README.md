    - **Note: this is only for development. Add the appropriate URL in the production environment.**

## Oracle Compute Configuration

- The production server is hosted on `Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Compute Instance`

> For the account credentials and SSH keys, contact the project administrator.

>**THIS IS A PRODUCTION SERVER!!! DONOT MODIFY ANY FILES ONCE LOGGED IN. ALWAYS CONSULT THE TEAM BEFORE TAKING ANY IRREVERSIBLE DECISION ON THE SERVER**

- The SSL Certification and HTTP->HTTPS forwarding is taken care by caddy (Check `Caddyfile` for more information)

- This file is just for reference, the actual file should be set at `/etc/caddy/Caddyfile`

    # dont forget to replace the directory placeholder with the actual name
    ```
- Copy the .env.example file to .env and change the relevant variables
    ```
